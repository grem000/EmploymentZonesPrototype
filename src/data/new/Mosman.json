To encourage investment in local commercial development that generates employment opportunities and economic growth.  To enable residential development that contributes to a vibrant and active local centre and is consistent with the Council's strategic planning for residential development in the area.  To encourage business, retail, community and other non-residential land uses on the ground floor of buildings.     To maintain active uses at street level, which reflect the traditional shop front proportions, with a predominance of retail use. To allow the amalgamation and redevelopment of land in Spit Junction.  To minimise the effect of business uses on the amenity of adjacent residential areas having regard to building design, operation and activities, traffic generation and the car parking capacity of local roads.   To maintain the local character of Mosman Junction by limiting the bulk and scale of development, and ensuring that development reflects the traditional shop front proportions at street level. To encourage development that is compatible with the centre's position on the centres hierarchy.",
